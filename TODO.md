### IDEAS
- I need to figure what DB I will be using, I want to use DigtialOcean(DO) and I need to learn how to intergrate or use DO database. 
- Actually, I need to learn the whole DO process - like host my app on their platform, intergrate data, etc - but I do have an account already so maybe that should be the next step before I dig to deep into this the rest of my app creation
